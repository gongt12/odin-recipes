            <h2>How to make Pad Krapao</h2>
                <p>Pad Kra Pao is considered Thai Fast food since it only takes <strong>20 minutes</strong> to make!
            This Pad Kra Pao is one of my favorite quick weeknight dinners that requires minimal ingredients, and is quite budget friendly. What I love is how quick and easy this is to make, but it also doesn't feel like fast food.</p>
                <p>Pad Kra Pao is a savory Thai stir fry dish that consists of ground meat, aromatics and Holy Basil. Kra Pao is translated into Holy Basil, but if you can not find Holy Basil, Thai Basil is a great substitute.</p>
